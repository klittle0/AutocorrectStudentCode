| March 12 |    2-3pm    |        After Mr. Blick's lecture, I implemented a tabulation approach to find the edit distance between any two Strings. |
| March 14 |  8:00-8:30  | I revised my tabulation approach and started researching ways to sort my words both alphabetically and by edit distance. |
| March 18 | 11:00-12:00 |                                    I settled on creating an arraylist of tuples/objects and finalized my runTest method. |
