| March 12 |      2-3pm      |                                                                                                                                                 After Mr. Blick's lecture, I implemented a tabulation approach to find the edit distance between any two Strings. |
| March 14 |   8:00-8:30am   |                                                                                                                                          I revised my tabulation approach and started researching ways to sort my words both alphabetically and by edit distance. |
| March 18 | 11:00am-12:00pm |                                                                                                                                                                             I settled on creating an arraylist of tuples/objects and finalized my runTest method. |
| March 20 |   8:00-8:40am   |                                            I finalized my object class, but none of the checks passed because I was calculating the edit distance incorrectly. I realized my tabulation approach wasn't adding/subtracting 1 at the right times, so I revised it. |
| March 20 |    8:45-10am    |                                            I brainstormed an n-gram solution will Liliana & started writing methods to make n grams, check whether a dictionary word was a good match for the typed word, and a method to make a shortlist of all possible words. |
| March 20 |  10:00-10:40am  |                                                                                                                                                                           I finished writing my methods to find n grams & create a short list for the dictionary. |
| March 21 |    2:00-3:00    |                                                                                                     Liliana & I modified our n-gram test to be a little more lenient, so it didn't eliminate any words that would =< threshold. Now, it works for all test cases. |
| March 23 |  12:30-1:15pm   |                                                             I started writing my main method so the user can work in the console. Right now, the interface is working decently, but for some reason, the words that are returned are each repeated like 10 times. |
| March 23 |   1:30-2:00pm   | I realized that I was unnecessarily iterating through the shortlist, causing repeats in my final printing. I removed this & updated the style of my console to work correctly. I went through my code to improve documentation and efficiency anywhere I saw fit. |
| March 23 |   3:00-3:45pm   |                                                                                                                                                                                       I calculated the time complexity for everything & completed my readme file. |
