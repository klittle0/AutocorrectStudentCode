| March 14 |   8:00-8:30am   | I revised my tabulation approach and started researching ways to sort my words both alphabetically and by edit distance. |
| March 18 | 11:00am-12:00pm |                                    I settled on creating an arraylist of tuples/objects and finalized my runTest method. |

| March 20 |  10:00-10:40am  |                                  I finished writing my methods to find n grams & create a short list for the dictionary. |
